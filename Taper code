and "Bitter Apologies." Israa Abbas developed a digital version of combining both
poems. The abstract concept of the six seperated lined bars indicaticating the uncertainty

<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="left" style="background:GREEN">The protests have risen. A guy with a black stick pulls me from the street and tells me that I sent false information to outside intelligence.</marquee></font>



<font color="WHITE"><marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" style="height:100px">I tried to reason with him but no point. This time in the form of possibly the last communication between us ever.</marquee></font>



<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="left" style="background:BLUE">Quickly hands me over to the police. All I got was a bruised thigh from a direct blow by an AK-47 handle.</marquee></font>



<font color="WHITE"><marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" style="height:100px">He was brought in the night before and was brutally beaten.</marquee></font>



<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="left" style="background:RED">He was my main partner for the rest of the prison stay, he was reciting beautiful poetry.</marquee></font>



<font color="WHITE"><marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" style="height:100px">One of them recognized one of his abusers as his neighbor.</marquee></font>



<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="right" style="background:GREEN">One of them was a 12 year old kid.</marquee></font>



<font color="WHITE"><marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" style="height:100px">One of the NISS agents later said to us: “We cannot go within these protests and get hurt, so we catch anyone near so our superiors know that we are working.”</marquee></font>



<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="left" style="background:BLUE">He knew only one person in Omdurman, I memorized the number while I was leaving prison but it wasn’t in service when I later called it.</marquee></font>



<font color="WHITE"><marquee direction="up" behavior="alternate" style="height:100px">It was killed before it was even born.</marquee></font>



<font color="BLACK"><marquee direction="left" style="background:RED">For now I’m trying to enjoy my freedom, a desire that is always blocked by the thought of my brothers that I left behind… </marquee></font>
